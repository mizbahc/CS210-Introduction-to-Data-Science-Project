# Spotify-Song-Genre-Analysis-and-PopularityPrediction


In this project we aim to gather information from the Spotify database.
This information will help us understand how songs of different eras
change overtime and will give us an analysis of the popular artists and songs. 
From there on we will use statistical tests to check how (or if) features contribute 
to popularity of songs and finally use different machine learning algorithms for 
prediction of song popularity and a simple song recommendation system that will
recommend some songs from each genre that has given.
